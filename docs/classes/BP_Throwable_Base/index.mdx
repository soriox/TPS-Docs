description: Class for throwable objects and explosives.

# Remarks

If "IsExplosive" is marked as true, the throwable object will act as an explosive with a timed or triggerable explosive. This also works as C4, smoke grenades, gas grenades, etc. If this marked as false. It will do nothing, allowing custom functionality to take over. This class will be adjusted in the near future to allow for things like RC Cars and Drones.
