# Remarks

This will turn off things like the player's visibility and disable the [Interaction Component](/components/BP_Interactor) while we possess another pawn.

# Actions

1. Calls [ClearWeaponUI()](/classes/BP_ThirdPersonCharacter/ClearWeaponUI) to clear the weapon UI currently on screen
2. Set collision to "No Collision"
3. Turns off the player pawn's visibility
4. Sets the Interactor Active to false on the [Interaction Component](/components/BP_Interactor)
5. Stops the last interaction that was happening (if still in progress) by calling [Stop Last Interaction](/components/BP_Interactor/StopLastInteraction)
