title: BP_Interactor()
description: Interaction detection component
---

# Remarks

This component is added to the [BP_ThirdPersonCharacter](/classes/BP_ThirdPersonCharacter). It will attempt to access the camera and cast a line trace forward to detect interactions.

Coming soon: You'll be able to use overlap collision to detect and trigger animations.
