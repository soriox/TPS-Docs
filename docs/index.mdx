This kit serves as a sort of remaster of the Lyra Shooter Game template provided by Epic Games. This kit however has more of a realistic shooter feel and is staying away from the Fortnite essence previously felt in Lyra. This kit does not directly include the Lyra Starter Game systems and code.

## Prerequisites

To get started you'll need Unreal Engine version 5.4 or higher and basic knowledge of Unreal Engine 5 and blueprints. At the moment there is no C++ code to manage.
