## Do have a roadmap for your Third Person Shooter Kit?

I'm actually in the process of adding one. I get a lot of requested features outside of my own mental roadmap so trying to balance those upcoming feature additions.

## Just to clarify, if i signed up on patreon for the $15 tier, this project is available to download right?

Yes, you get everything you see in the kit.

## Can you upload this template to FAB(ex Unreal Marketplace)? 

Although I understand this is favorable, this may never happen due to the project not passing the submission process for Fab.com
