## Do have a roadmap for your Third Person Shooter Kit?

A roadmap is now ready! Check it out here: https://trello.com/invite/b/6756634aac8bf3f331d0edfa/ATTIc4e7b3970c7bf6bac3024d6d1a215f5d59B03C05/third-person-shooter-kit

## Just to clarify, if i signed up on patreon for the $15 tier, this project is available to download right?

Yes, you get everything you see in the kit.

## Can you upload this template to FAB(ex Unreal Marketplace)? 

Although I understand this is favorable, this may never happen due to the project not passing the submission process for Fab.com
